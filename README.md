**Problem Statement**
Given the following JSON data
[{"Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 171, "WeightKg": 96 },
{ "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 161, "WeightKg": 85 },
{ "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 180, "WeightKg": 77 },
{ "Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 166, "WeightKg": 62},
{"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 150, "WeightKg": 70},
{"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 167, "WeightKg": 82}]
as the input with weight and height parameters of a person, we have to perform the following:
1) Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1, BMI Category and Health risk
from Table 1 of the person and add them as 3 new columns
2) Count the total number of overweight people using ranges in the column BMI Category
of Table 1, check this is consistent programmatically and add any other observations in
the documentation


Formula 1 - BMI
BMI(kg/m
2) = mass(kg) / height(m)
2
The BMI (Body Mass Index) in (kg/m
2
) is equal to the weight in kilograms (kg) divided by your
height in meters squared (m)
Table 1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.
BMI Category BMI Range (kg/m2) Health risk
Underweight 18.4 and below Malnutrition risk
Normal weight 18.5 - 24.9 Low risk
Overweight 25 - 29.9 Enhanced risk
Moderately obese 30 - 34.9 Medium risk
Severely obese 35 - 39.9 High risk
Very severely obese 40 and above Very high risk
